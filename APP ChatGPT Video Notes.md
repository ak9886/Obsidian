## Unit 3 → Advanced Java / Programming Paradigms

**1.** [What are Programming Paradigms?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGufrjzbiZw) – introduces procedural, object-oriented, functional paradigms.

- Alignment: Good foundational match. Not Java-specific, so you may need to map examples to Java.  
    **2.** [4 Programming Paradigms in 40 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgVVZMfLjEI) – compares different languages each illustrating a paradigm.
    
- Alignment: Broad view; SRMIST likely expects deeper Java-based examples.  
    **3.** [Advanced Java Programming Tutorials [2024 Updated]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEiEAq2VkUUJITAa4rvcToEG3pLcL0Onh) – full-course covering Java “advanced” topics.
    
- Alignment: Strong for Java focus; check it covers threads, JDBC, AWT/Applets as per your slide content.  
    **4.** [Advanced Java Tutorial Videos | Mr. Nataraj](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVlQHNRLflP9OiTKTQuq3UWJNA_wOPlFr) – series of advanced Java topics (JSE/JME etc).
    
- Alignment: Good depth; might go beyond SRMIST syllabus, so choose relevant segments.  
    **5.** [Java Full Course for free (2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTtL8E4LzTQ) – covers everything needed to start coding Java comprehensively.
    
- Alignment: Great for completeness; may contain beginner sections you can skip if you’re already familiar.

## Unit 4 → Functional / Logic Paradigms & GUI / Modern Paradigms

**1.** [Programming Paradigm – Lecture 1 | Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps8jOj7diA0) – university-level lecture on programming paradigms.

- Alignment: Strong theory, but language/context may differ (Stanford uses other languages).  
    **2.** [Lecture 23 | Programming Paradigms (Stanford)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJkH1CSHg44) – deeper dive into paradigms.
    
- Alignment: Similar note as above; excellent theory foundation.  
    **3.** [Advanced Java Full Course 2023 | Advance Java Tutorial | J2EE, JSP, JDBC, Java API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae-r8hsbPUo) – covers JDBC, APIs, which map to your slide’s Java/Database connectivity part.
    
- Alignment: Very relevant to Java + JDBC component.  
    **4.** [Java Programming (Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqleLpAMfxGAdqZeY_4uVQOPCnAjhH-eT) – core Java syllabus playlist, includes GUI, objects etc.
    
- Alignment: Good for GUI parts (AWT/Applets) though might mix with basic topics.  
    **5.** [Advanced Java Practice Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b93mslJ2j8) – focused practice problems in advanced Java.
    
- Alignment: Useful for lab/practical preparation; ensures you apply the theory.

## How well this aligns with SRMIST’s structure

- SRMIST’s course “Advanced Programming Practice (18CSC207J / 21CSC203P)” lists outcomes like structured, procedural, object-oriented, functional, logic, automata, GUI programming. ([Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/in/course/srm-institute-of-science-and-technology/advanced-programming-practices/6042915?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Advanced Programming Practices - 18CSC207J"))
    
- The selected videos cover the major topics: programming paradigms (Unit 3), Java advanced topics (threads/JDBC/GUI), functional & logic paradigms (Unit 4).
    
- Limitations: Some videos may use languages other than Java, or cover slightly different examples than SRMIST’s labs (AWT/Applets vs newer frameworks).
    
- My recommendation: Use these videos as _supplemental resources_, but continue cross-checking your SRMIST syllabus and lecture notes to ensure full alignment.
