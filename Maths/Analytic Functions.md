Analytic Functions:

- Analytic Function: A function is said to be *analytic at a point if its derivative exists not only at that point but also in some neighbourhood of that point*. Analytic functions are also called Regular functions or Holomorphic functions.

- Cauchy-Riemann Equations (Necessary Condition): The necessary conditions for a function f(z) = u + iv to be analytic are:
  u_x = v_y  and  u_y = -v_x  
  These are also known as the C-R equations. The source notes that while the satisfaction of C-R equations is necessary for analyticity, the converse is not always true.

- Sufficient Condition for Analyticity: If  
  (i) u_x, u_y, v_x, v_y are all *continuous functions* and  
  (ii) u_x = v_y and u_y = -v_x,  
  then f(z) = u + iv is analytic.

- Harmonic Function: A real function phi is said to be a *harmonic function if it has second order continuous partial derivatives and satisfies the Laplace equation*, i.e.,  
  ∂²φ/∂x² + ∂²φ/∂y² = 0  
  or  
  ∇²φ = 0  
  The source also notes that if f(z) = u + iv is an analytic function, then u and v are harmonic.

Conformal Mapping:

- Conformal Mapping: A transformation that *preserves the angle between every pair of curves through a point both in magnitude and sense (direction)* is called conformal mapping.

- Isogonal Mapping: A transformation that *preserves the angle between every pair of curves through a point only in magnitude and not in sense* is called isogonal mapping.

- Critical Points: A point at which the function is *not conformal* is called a critical point. This occurs at points where the derivative f'(z) = 0.

Bilinear Transformation:

- Bilinear Transformation: The transformation of the form  
  w = (az + b) / (cz + d)  
  where a, b, c, d are complex constants such that  
  ad - bc ≠ 0,  
  is called a Bilinear transformation. It is also known as Mobius transformation or linear fractional transformation.
