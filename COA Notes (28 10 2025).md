# Unit 4

## An instruction can be executed by performing one or more of the following operations
- Transfer a word of data from one processor to another


## Inside the System:
- ALU
- Register for temp storage
- Various Digi circuits for executing different micro operations (gates, MUX, decoders, counters)
- Internal path for movement of data between ALU and registers
- Driver circuits
- Transmitter Circuits
## Register Transfers
- The input and output gates for registers R<sub>1</sub> are controlled by signals in Ri<sub>in</sub> and Ri<sub>out</sub>
WMFC - Wait for Memory Function to Complete


## Storing a word from memory
- Address is loaded into MAR.
- Data be written loaded into MDR
- write commands is issued
- Example:
<center>
- Move R2,(R1) - 
<br>
- R1(out), MDR (in), Write - 
<br>
- MDR(out)E, WMFC -
<br>
</center>
