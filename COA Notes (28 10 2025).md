<br>
## Inside the System:
- <br>
- ALU
- <br>
- Register for temp storage
- <br>
- Various Digi circuits for executing different micro operations (gates, MUX, decoders, counters)
- <br>
- Internal path for movement of data between ALU and registers
- <br>
- Driver circuits
- <br>
- Transmitter Circuits
<br>
## Register Transfers
- <br>
- The input and output gates for registers R<sub>1</sub> are controlled by signals in Ri<sub>in</sub> and Ri<sub>out</sub>
