# How to handle deadlocks (or) Methods for handling deadlocks
1) there are 3 methods:
	- Ignore Deadlocks
2) Ensure deadlock never occurs using their
	- Prevention:
		- Prevent any of the one of the conditions never happens
	- Avoidance:
		- Allow all deadlock conditions, but calculate cycles and stop dangerous operations.
3) Allow deadlock to happen. This requires both:


# Deadlock Characterization
Deadlock Can arise if __four__ conditions hold **simultaneously**


# Details 
- The resource allocation graph consists of the following sets:
	- P ={ P1,P2,P3} 
# Deadlock Prevention
When we try to avoid deadlock -> Utilization is less and system throughput is low




# Problem

| Process | -------Allocation<br>A     B    C | Max        | Available  |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| P0      | 0     1     0                     | 7    5   3 | 3   3    2 |
