## Pre-emptive Scheduling Problems

| Process ID | Arrival Time | Burst Time | Priority |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------- |
| P1         | 0            | 4          | 2        |
| P2         | 1            | 3          | 3        |
| P3         | 2            | 1          | 4        |
| P4         | 3            | 5          | 5        |
| P5         | 4            | 2          | 5        |
Higher Number Represents Higher Priority



| Gannt Chart    | P1  | P2  | P3  | P4  | P5  | P2  | P1  |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starts at:   0 | 1   | 2   | 3   | 8   | 10  | 12  | 15  |
Turn Around Time = Exit Time - Arrival Time


| Process | Exit Time | Turn Around Time | Wait Time |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| P1      | 15        | 15-0=15          | 15-4=11   |
| P2      | 12        | 12-1=11          | 11-3=8    |
| P3      | 3         | 3-2=1            | 1-1=0     |
| P4      | 8         | 8-3=5            | 5-5=0     |
| P5      | 10        | 10-4=6           | 6-2=4     |
### Example 2: Priority non-pre-emptive

| Process ID | Arrival Time | Burst Time | Priority |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------- |
| P1         | 0            | 4          | 2        |
| P2         | 1            | 3          | 3        |
| P3         | 2            | 1          | 4        |
| P4         | 3            | 5          | 5        |
| P5         | 4            | 2          | 5        |

| Gannt Chart    | P1  | P4  | P5  | P3  | P2  |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starts at:   0 | 4   | 9   | 11  | 12  | 15  |

| Process ID | Exit Time | Turn Around Time | Wait Time |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| P1         | 4         | 4-3=1            | 1-1=0     |
| P2         | 6         | 6-1=5            | 5-4=1     |
| P3         | 8         | 8-4=4            | 4-2=2     |
| P4         | 16        | 16-0=16          | 16-6=10   |
| P5         | 11        | 11-2=9           | 9-3=6     |


## Scheduling Algorithms
1) First-Come, First-Serve Scheduling
2) Shortest-Job-First Scheduling
	1) Simultaneous arrival times
	2) Varied arrival times
	3) Pre-emptive SJF with varied arrival times = Shortest-remaining time First (SRT) Scheduling
3) Priority Scheduling
	1) Pre-emptive & non-pre-emptive
4) Round Robin Scheduling
5) Multi-level Queue Scheduling
6) Multi-level Feedback Queue Scheduling
## Deadlocks
- Assume 2 Processes, P1 and P2
- When P1 Process is holding R1 and requesting resource R2, where it is held by the process P2. This state is <font color="#7030a0">Deadlock</font>
