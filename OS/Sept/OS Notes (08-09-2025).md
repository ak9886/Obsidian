# Scheduling Criteria
- Different CPU scheduling algorithms have different properties
	- CPU ULIT
		- CPU util. ranges from 0% to 100%
		- Lightly Loaded Systems [] 40%
		- Heavily Loaded Systems [] 90%
	- Throughput = Number of processes completed/ unit time
	- Response time = Amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response occurs
	- Waiting Time - The amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response is received
# Scheduling Algorithms
1) First Come, First Served (FCFS)
2) Shortest Job First (SJF)
	- Simultaneous arrival times
	- Varied arrival times
	- Pre-emptive SJF with varied times



# FCFS
- First entered, first serviced
- If 3 Processes are waiting, P1, P2, P3... then P1 will have 0 waiting time, while P2 and P3 will have to wait for 24 and 27 seconds respectively
- The millisecond that a Process is completed, then the next process starts, i.e. P1 ends at 24 seconds and P2 starts at 24 seconds, etc.
- Completed times = 24, 27, 30
- Average Waiting Time = (0+24+27)/3 = 17
- Average Turnaround (Completion) Time = (3+6+30)/3 = 17

# Question 
Consider the following set of processes that arrive at `time = 0` with length of the CPU burst in milliseconds

| Process | Burst Time |
| ------- | ---------- |
| P1      | 24         |
| P2      | 3          |
| P3      | 3          |
Average Waiting Time = TAT - BT
TAT = Completion time - Arrival time

Gantt Chart (Order Of Arrival Of Processes)

P1 = 24 |   P2 = 27   | P3 = 30 |

Average Waiting Time = (0+24+27)/3 = 17ms
Average Turnaround Time = (24+27+30)/3 = 27ms


SJF (Shortest Job First) Scheduling
P1 - (3)
P2 - (1)
P3 - (2)



| Process | Arrival | BT  |
| ------- | ------- | --- |
| P1      | 0       | 7   |
| P2      | 2       | 4   |
| P3      | 4       | 1   |
| P4      | 5       | 4   |
