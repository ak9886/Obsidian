| Arrival Time (in ms) | 0   | 2   | 4   | 7   | 11  | 16  |
Avg. Wait Time = $$[(0 - 0) + (11-2)] + [(2-2)+(5-2-2)] + (4-4) +(7-5)$$
Average Time = $$(16-0)+(7-2)+(5-4)+\frac{11-5}{4} = 7ms$$

Avg. Wait Time = $$[0+(10-4)] + 4 + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{17}{3} = 5.6ms$$
Avg. Total Time = $$30+7+\frac{10}{3} = \frac{47}{3} = 15.\overline{66}$$
