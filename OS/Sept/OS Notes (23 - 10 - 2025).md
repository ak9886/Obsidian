# Page replacement Algorithm
- Page Faults - When a page is not found in the main memory
<u>Algorithm</u>
1) FIFO - First In First Out
2) LRU (Least Recently) 
3) Optimal
Optimal - Replaced which would no used for longest duration of time in the future
<u>Example</u>: 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 0 4 2 3 0 3 2 3


<u>LEAST RECENTLY USED</u> - 0
<u>Example</u>
	Consider 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2
	Number of Frames = 3 using FIFO
1) Stepwise Calculation
2) Schematic Representation
3) Page Fault
# Disk Scheduling Algorithm - Problem Question
## Question 1: 
The Disk Head is at track 50.
The queue of I/O requests is 82,170,43,140,24,16,190 use <b>FCFS</b> disk scheduling. 
Find: 
1) Total head movement
2) Order of servicing requests
