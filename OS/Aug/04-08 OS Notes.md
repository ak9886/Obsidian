#OS 
# Kernel Data Structures
- Many similar to standard programming data structures
- # Singly Linked List
- # Doubly Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
	- Root directory (First) 
	- Parent
	- Child 

- Balanced Binary Search Tree: $O(lg (n))$
- Hash function can create a hash map
- Distributed Computing
	- Collection of separate, possible heterogenous, systems networked together
		- Network is a communication path, TCP/IP most common
			- Local Area Network (LAN)
			- Wide Area Network (WAN)
			- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
			- Personal Area Network (PAN)
	- Network Operating System provides features between systems across network
		- Communication scheme allows system to exchange messages
		- Illusion of a single system
- Virtualization
	- Allows operating systems to run applications with other OSes.
		- Vast and growing industry
	- Emulation used when source CPU is a different type to the target type
	- When the computer language not compiled to native code - Interpretation
- System calls:
	- Programming Interface to the services provided by the OS
	- Typically written in high-level language (C or C++)
	- Mostly accessed by programs via a high-level application programming interface (API) rather than direct system call use
	- Three most common APIs are Win32 API for Windows, POSIX API for POSIX- based systems (Including virtually all versions of UNIX, Linux, and Mac OSX) and Java API for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
		- *(Note that the system-call names used through this text are generic)*
	- API - System Call - OS Relationship
		- Last In, First Out Arrangement
	- Process Control
		- Create process, terminate process
	- File management
		- Create file, delete file
		- open/close file
		- read, write, reposition
		- get and set file attributes
	- Device management
		- Request device, release device
		- read, write, reposition
	- Information Maintenance
		- Get the time or date, set time or date
		- get system data, set system data
		- get and set process, file, or device attributes
	- Communications
		- Create, delete communication connection
		- send, receive messages if message passing model to host name or process name
			- Form client to server
		- Protection
			- Control access to resources
			- Get and set permissions
			- allow and deny user access
	- MS-DOS
		- Single tasking
		- Shell invoked when system booted
		- Simple method to run program
			- No process created
		- Single memory space
		- Loads program into memory, overwriting all but the kernel
		-  Program exit --> shell reloaded
	- System programs
		- Provide a convenient environment for program development and execution
		- File Modification
			- Text editors
		- Programming-language support - Compilers, assemblers
		- Background Services 
			- Load at boot time
				- Some for system startup
