### **Part B – (10 Marks Each)**

**Q6.** Describe in detail the various services provided by an operating system.  
**A:**  
- **User Interface:** CLI, GUI, Batch.  
- **Program Execution:** Load, run, terminate programs.  
- **I/O Operations:** Manage device/file interactions.  
- **File-system Manipulation:** Create, delete, search, permissions.  
- **Communications:** Shared memory, message passing.  
- **Error Detection:** Detect and handle errors in CPU, memory, I/O.  
- **Resource Allocation:** CPU cycles, memory, I/O devices.  
- **Accounting:** Track resource usage.  
- **Protection & Security:** Access control, authentication.

**Q7.** Suitable OS structure for loosely coupled system?  
**A:** **Layered Approach** – OS divided into layers from hardware (layer 0) to UI (layer N). Changes in one layer don’t affect others, simplifying debugging and maintenance.

---

**Q8.** Describe the client–server and peer-to-peer models of distributed systems.  
**A:**  
- **Client–Server:** Clients request, servers respond (compute/file servers).  
- **Peer-to-Peer:** All nodes act as both clients and servers; services distributed; may use centralized lookup or broadcast discovery.

**Q9.** Identify and explain types of system calls with UNIX equivalents.  
**A:**  
- **SetFileSecurity() → chmod()** (Protection)  
- **CreateProcess() → fork()** (Process Control)  
- **GetCurrentProcessID() → getpid()** (Information Maintenance)  
- **ReadFile() → read()** (File Management)  
- **SetConsoleMode() → ioctl()** (Device Management)

## **SET B**

### **Part A – (1 Mark Each)**

**Q1.** Device controller informs CPU operation finished via  
**A:** Interrupt.

**Q2.** OS concept that allows multiple programs to run by dividing CPU time  
**A:** Multitasking.

**Q3.** Key characteristic of a distributed OS  
**A:** Resource sharing among multiple systems.

**Q4.** Component handling execution of all processes  
**A:** Process Manager.

**Q5.** Main purpose of virtual memory  
**A:** Provide the illusion of larger physical memory.

### **Part B – (10 Marks Each)**

**Q6.** Monolithic, Layered, Microkernel OS structures – pros & cons:  
- **Monolithic:** All OS in one binary; fast but less modular.  
- **Layered:** OS split into layers; modular, easier debugging.  
- **Microkernel:** Minimal core, other services in user space; more secure, modular, but may have overhead.

**Q7.** Designing OS for various computing environments:  
- **Traditional:** Stand-alone, network-connected.  
- **Mobile:** Smartphones/tablets with sensors.  
- **Distributed:** Networked heterogeneous systems.  
- **Client–Server:** Request/response model.  
- **P2P:** No fixed client/server roles.

---

**Q8.** Selecting system programs:  
- **File Management:** Create, delete, manipulate files.  
- **Status Info:** Date, time, memory.  
- **File Modification:** Editors.  
- **Language Support:** Compilers, assemblers.  
- **Program Execution:** Loaders, debuggers.  
- **Communications:** Messaging between processes/users.

**Q9.** Coherence of cached data:  
- **Single Processor:** Single CPU with device-specific processors; simpler coherence.  
- **Multiprocessor:** Multiple CPUs share memory; risk of stale data; requires coordination.

### **Part B – (10 Marks Each)**

**Q6.** Five OS services:  
1. Program execution  
2. I/O operations  
3. File-system manipulation  
4. Communications  
5. Error detection

**Q7.** Highly modular OS architecture: **Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs)** – core kernel + dynamically loadable modules for device drivers, file systems, etc.

---

**Q8.** Performance of storage levels:  
- **Primary (RAM):** Fast, volatile.  
- **Secondary (HDD, NVM):** Larger, slower, non-volatile.  
- **Tertiary (Tapes):** Very large, very slow.  
- **Firmware (EEPROM):** Non-volatile, infrequently updated.

**Q9.**  
a) Choice of OS at boot – bootstrap program locates, loads kernel. BIOS/UEFI boot process.  
b) Debugging – finding/fixing errors; kernel crash dumps, logs, debugging tools.
