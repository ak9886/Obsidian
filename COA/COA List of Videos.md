### **Video 1: Introduction to Computer Organization and Architecture**
Source: [[]]

**1. Overview of COA**

- Computer Organization focuses on the **operational units and their interconnections** that realize the architectural specifications.
    
- Computer Architecture deals with **the functional behavior as seen by the programmer**, including instruction sets, data formats, and addressing modes.
    
- The key distinction: **Organization = How it works internally**, **Architecture = How it looks externally**.
    

**2. Functional Units**

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply) and logical (AND, OR, XOR) operations.
    
- **Registers:** Small, fast storage units inside CPU for temporary data. Examples include `ACC`, `PC`, and general-purpose registers.
    
- **Control Unit (CU):** Interprets instructions and generates control signals to orchestrate data movement between units.
    
- **Memory Unit:** Divided into primary (RAM) and secondary storage (HDD/SSD). Uses hierarchical structure: registers → cache → main memory → secondary memory.
    
- **Input/Output Units:** Interface with peripherals, usually via buses and I/O controllers.
    

**3. CPU Components**

- **Datapath:** Includes ALU, registers, and buses. Responsible for executing instructions.
    
- **Control Signals:** Generated by the CU to manage data movement and ALU operations.
    
- **Instruction Cycle:** Fetch → Decode → Execute → Store. Each step corresponds to signals from the control unit.
    

**4. Instruction Types**

- **Data Transfer Instructions:** Move data between memory, registers, and I/O devices (`MOV`, `LOAD`, `STORE`).
    
- **Arithmetic/Logical Instructions:** Perform calculations or bitwise operations (`ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`).
    
- **Control Instructions:** Change the sequence of execution (`JUMP`, `CALL`, `RETURN`).
    

**5. Memory Hierarchy and Speed**

- **Registers:** Fastest, smallest, internal to CPU.
    
- **Cache:** L1, L2, L3 levels; reduces average memory access time.
    
- **Main Memory (RAM):** Slower but larger.
    
- **Secondary Storage:** Slowest, used for bulk data.
    
- **Principle:** Frequently accessed data is kept in faster memory (locality of reference).
    

**6. Example Walkthrough**

- Fetch instruction from memory → CU decodes opcode → appropriate registers selected → ALU performs operation → result stored back → PC incremented.
    
- Diagram described: Shows instruction flowing from memory to CU to ALU to registers and back to memory.
