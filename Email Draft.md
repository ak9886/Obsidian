Respected Sir/Maâ€™am,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Adarsh Koshy, a second-year student, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science with my specialization in Cybersecurity at SRM University . I am very interested in exploring internship opportunities at IIT and would like to know more about the programs currently available as well as the application process.

Could you kindly provide details on any ongoing or upcoming internships and the prerequisites required to apply? I would greatly value your guidance.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
