## Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Hackthon Matcher App

**1. Introduction**

This PRD outlines the requirements for a mobile application ("MatchHub") designed to connect users with relevant Hacakthons. The app will leverage user profiles, Hacakthon data, and algorithm-driven matching to facilitate discovery and connection, ultimately increasing participation in these events. Our goal is to streamline the often-frustrating process of finding and joining Hacakthons.

**2. Goals**

- **Increase Hacakthon Participation:** By making it easier to find and connect with Hacakthons, we aim to increase user engagement and participation.
- **Improve User Experience:** Provide a seamless and intuitive platform for users to discover and join Hacakthons.
- **Grow the MatchHub Community:** Foster a community of users and organizers focused on Hacakthon events.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Collect data on user behavior to optimize the app and Hacakthon offerings.

**3. Target Audience**

- **Users:** Individuals, groups, and teams interested in participating in Hacakthons. (Specifically: aspiring developers, designers, marketers, etc.)
- **Organizers:** Hacakthon organizers seeking to efficiently match participants with suitable events.

**4. Product Features & Functionality**

**4.1 Core Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)**

- **User Profiles:**
    - **Basic Info:** Name, Email, Location (optional)
    - **Skill/Area of Expertise:** (Categorized: e.g., Frontend, Backend, UI/UX, Data Science, etc.) - Using a dropdown/selection list.
    - **Hacakthon History:** Record of past Hacakthon participation (number of events attended, feedback, etc.) - Allow users to select past events.
    - **Interest Tags:** Allow users to specify interests beyond skills (e.g., "Game Development," "Cloud Computing," "Social Media").
- **Hacakthon Listing & Search:**
    - **Search:** Keyword search by Hacakthon name, location, skill focus, and organizer.
    - **Filtering:** Filter by date, location, skill focus, and event type (e.g., workshops, competitions).
    - **Trending Hacakthons:** Display popular and recently created Hacakthons.
- **Matching Algorithm:**
    - **Initial Match:** Based on user profiles, suggest initial matches based on shared skills and interests.
    - **Prioritized Matches:** Rank matches based on relevance and popularity within the user's profile.
- **Map View:** Display nearby Hacakthons on a map (optional, to improve local discovery).

**4.2 Secondary Features (Post-MVP - Roadmap)**

- **Real-Time Notifications:** Send updates about new Hacakthons matching the user's preferences.
- **Event Details:** Detailed information about each Hacakthon (schedule, location, speakers, requirements).
- **Feedback & Ratings:** Allow users to rate and provide feedback on Hacakthon experiences.
- **Group Features:** (Optional) Enable users to form groups based on Hacakthon interests.
- **Organizer Dashboard:** Provide organizers with tools to manage their Hacakthon events, including attendee tracking.
- **Social Integration:** (Future) Allow users to share matches and Hacakthon events on social media.
- **Gamification (Optional):** Points, badges, or leaderboards to incentivize participation.

**5. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX) Considerations**

- **Intuitive Navigation:** Easy-to-understand menu structure.
- **Clean & Visually Appealing:** Modern design with clear visual hierarchy.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Optimized for mobile devices.
- **Personalized Experience:** Tailor the app experience to individual user preferences.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG).

**6. Technical Considerations**

- **Platform:** iOS and Android (initially, then consider web version).
- **Database:** Cloud-based database (e.g., Firebase, AWS DynamoDB) for scalability and data management.
- **Matching Algorithm:** Utilize a combination of:
    - **Rule-Based Matching:** Predefined rules based on skills and interests.
    - **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommend matches based on the behavior of similar users.
    - **Hybrid Approach:** Combine the above for optimal results.
- **API Integrations:** Potential for integrations with Hacakthon organizersâ€™ systems.

**7. Release Criteria**

- **Functional Testing:** All core features must be thoroughly tested.
- **Usability Testing:** Gather feedback from target users to ensure a good user experience.
- **Performance Testing:** Ensure the app runs smoothly and efficiently.
- **Security Testing:** Protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.

**8. Success Metrics**

- **Number of Registered Users:** Track user acquisition.
- **Number of Hacakthon Participants:** Measure user engagement with the app.
- **Match Rate:** Percentage of users successfully matched with Hacakthons.
- **User Retention Rate:** Percentage of users who continue to use the app over time.
- **User Satisfaction:** Measured through surveys and feedback forms.

**9. Timeline & Milestones (Example)**

- **Phase 1 (4 Weeks):** UX/UI Design, Database Setup, Core Matching Algorithm Implementation (MVP).
- **Phase 2 (6 Weeks):** User Profile Development, Hacakthon Listing & Search Functionality.
- **Phase 3 (4 Weeks):** Notification System Implementation, Map Integration (optional).
- **Phase 4 (2 Weeks):** Beta Testing & Iteration.
- **Phase 5 (Ongoing):** Feature Enhancements & Iteration based on User Feedback & Data Analysis.

**10. Budget (Placeholder - Requires Detailed Cost Analysis)**

- **Development Costs:** $15,000 - $30,000 (depending on complexity)
- **Database & Hosting Costs:** $50/month - $200/month
- **Marketing & Promotion:** $2,000 - $5,000 (initial launch)
