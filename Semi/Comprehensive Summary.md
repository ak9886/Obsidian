## **Unit 1: Free Electron Theory and Energy Bands**

### Classical Free Electron Theory

* Proposed by Drude and Lorentz.
* Treats electrons in a metal like an ideal gas.
* Assumes elastic collisions and classical velocity distribution.
* Successfully explains Ohm's Law, thermal and electrical conductivities, and Wiedemann-Franz law.
* Fails to explain photoelectric effect, specific heat, magnetism, and behavior of semiconductors.

### Quantum Free Electron Theory

* Developed by Sommerfeld using quantum mechanics.
* Electrons obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.
* Correctly explains electrical conductivity, specific heat, and magnetic susceptibility.

### Density of States (DOS)

* Defines the number of electron states per unit volume per energy interval.
* Used to calculate carrier concentration in metals/semiconductors.
* Given as: $Z(E) \propto E^{1/2}$

### Kronig-Penney Model

* Simplified 1D periodic potential.
* Explains formation of energy bands and band gaps.
* Wavefunctions determined via Schrödinger equation.

## **Unit 2: Semiconductor Fundamentals**

### Intrinsic Semiconductors

* Pure materials like Si and Ge.
* Equal number of electrons and holes: $n = p$.
* Conductivity: $\sigma_i = ne\mu_e + pe\mu_h$

### Extrinsic Semiconductors

* Doped with trivalent or pentavalent atoms.
* N-type: Donors provide electrons.
* P-type: Acceptors create holes.
* Fermi level shifts based on doping and temperature.

### Carrier Generation and Recombination

* **Types:** Optical, Shockley-Read-Hall (phonon), Auger, Impact ionization.
* **Recombination:** Radiative (photon emission), Non-radiative (phonon emission).
* Excess carriers decay over characteristic lifetimes.

## **Unit 3: Optical and Recombination Processes**

### Optical Transitions

* Band-to-band (interband), impurity-to-band, and intra-band.
* Photons must have energy $h\nu \geq E_g$.

### Absorption and Emission

* Absorption increases carrier concentration.
* Emission types: spontaneous and stimulated.

### Recombination

* Occurs when electrons fall from conduction to valence band.
* **Radiative:** Photon emission (used in LEDs).
* **Non-radiative:** Energy released as phonons.

### Luminescence Types

* Photoluminescence, Electroluminescence, Cathodoluminescence.

### Einstein Coefficients

* Define probabilities of absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission.
* $A_{21}, B_{12}, B_{21}$

### Quasi-Fermi Levels

* In non-equilibrium, separate levels for electrons and holes: $E_{Fn}, E_{Fp}$

## **Unit 4: Electrical Measurements & Hall Effect**

### Two-Point Probe

* Measures resistance by applying current and measuring voltage.
* Affected by contact and spreading resistance.

### Four-Point Probe

* Eliminates contact resistance by separating current and voltage paths.
* **Collinear method:** For bulk or thin films.
* **Van der Pauw method:** For irregular samples.

### Hall Effect

* When current-carrying conductor placed in magnetic field, a Hall voltage develops.
* Used to determine carrier type (n/p), mobility, and carrier concentration.

### Hall Voltage:

$V_H = \frac{IB}{net}$

## **Unit 5: Low Dimensional Systems and Nanoscience**

### Density of States in 0D, 1D, 2D

* **3D (bulk):** $DOS \propto \sqrt{E}$
* **2D (quantum well):** Step-like constant DOS.
* **1D (quantum wire):** $DOS \propto 1/\sqrt{E}$
* **0D (quantum dot):** Discrete energy levels (delta function).

### Quantum Structures

* **Quantum well:** Electron free in 2D.
* **Quantum wire:** Free in 1D.
* **Quantum dot:** Confined in all dimensions.

### Nanoscience and Nanotechnology

* **Nanoscale (1-100 nm):** Properties become size and shape dependent.
* Increased surface-to-volume ratio enhances chemical reactivity.
* Novel optical, electrical, mechanical properties emerge.

### Applications

* High efficiency lasers, HEMTs, optoelectronics, catalysis.

### Examples

* Gold nanoparticles: color change due to quantum confinement.
* Lycurgus Cup: ancient example of nanotech (colloidal gold).

### Nanomaterial Synthesis

* **Top-down:** Lithography, milling.
* **Bottom-up:** Self-assembly, chemical synthesis.
