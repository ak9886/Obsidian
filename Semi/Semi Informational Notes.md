## 🧩 UNIT 1: Free Electron Theories and Band Structure

### Classical Free Electron Theory (Drude-Lorentz)

- Electrons behave like gas molecules.

- Ignores electron-electron interactions.

- Obeys Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

- Explains: Ohm's law, Wiedemann-Franz Law, basic optical properties.

- Limitations: Cannot explain photoelectric effect, ferromagnetism, specific heat anomaly.


### Quantum Free Electron Theory (Sommerfeld Model)

- Applies quantum principles and Fermi-Dirac statistics.

- Electrons treated as wave-like.

- Energy: En = n²h² / 8mL²

- Conductivity: σ = ne²τ/m

- Advantages: Explains conductivity, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility.


### Density of States (DOS)

- Z(E)dE = Number of electron states per unit volume in energy interval dE.

- Important for calculating carrier concentrations.


### Kronig-Penney Model

- Describes electron behavior in periodic potentials.

- Leads to formation of energy bands and gaps.

- Solves Schrodinger's equation in periodic square-well potential.




## ⚛️ UNIT 2: Semiconductor Fundamentals

### Intrinsic Semiconductors

- Pure materials like Si or Ge.

- Equal number of electrons (n) and holes (p).

- Conductivity: σ = neμ_e + peμ_h


### Extrinsic Semiconductors

- **n-type**: Doped with pentavalent atoms (e.g., P, As).

- Donor level close to conduction band.

- **p-type**: Doped with trivalent atoms (e.g., Al, B).

- Acceptor level close to valence band.

- Doping alters Fermi level position.

### Carrier Generation and Recombination

- **Generation**: Absorption of photons or energy.

- **Recombination**: Electron-hole annihilation.

- Radiative: photon emission.

- Non-radiative: phonon emission.

- Mechanisms:

- Photon transition

- Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH)

- Auger recombination

- Impact ionization

## 💡 UNIT 3: Optical Transitions & Emission Processes

### Optical Transitions

- **Band-to-band (interband)**: Eg. GaAs, Eg = 1.42eV

- **Impurity to band**: Eg. Hg-doped Ge

- **Intra-band**: Free carrier transitions


### Absorption

- Occurs if hν ≥ Eg

- Increases conductivity (photoconductors)


### Emission

- **Spontaneous**: Random photon release.

- **Stimulated**: Emitted photon mirrors incoming photon.


### Einstein Coefficients

- B12, B21: absorption & stimulated emission

- A21: spontaneous emission

- Steady-state: N1B12Q = N2A21 + N2B21Q


### Quantum Efficiency

- η_r = τ_nr / (τ_r + τ_nr)

- High efficiency: long non-radiative lifetime

## 🔌 UNIT 4: Electrical Measurements

### Ohm's Law & Resistivity

- V = IR; R = ρL/A

- σ = 1/ρ


### Two-Point Probe

- Simple but errors due to contact/spread resistance


### Four-Point Probe

- Outer probes: current source

- Inner probes: voltage measurement

- Advantage: eliminates contact resistance


#### Types:

1. **Collinear Probe (Bulk/Thin Film)**:

- Bulk: spherical current flow

- Thin: ring current flow

1. **Van der Pauw Method**:

- For arbitrary shapes, uniform thickness

- Requires 8 measurements

- Can determine ρ, carrier type, sheet density, mobility


### Hall Effect

- Voltage generated in transverse magnetic field

- Determines carrier type and mobility
