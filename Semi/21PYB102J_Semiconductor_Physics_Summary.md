## UNIT 1: Classical and Quantum Free Electron Theories

### Classical Free Electron Theory
- Proposed by Drude and Lorentz (1900).
- Electrons move like a gas, free within a metal lattice.
- Ignores electron-electron interaction and potential energy.
- Assumptions:
  - Free electrons move randomly and obey classical mechanics.
  - Obey Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
  - Collisions are elastic.
- Successes:
  - Explains Ohm’s Law, thermal/electrical conductivity, Wiedemann–Franz law.
- Failures:
  - Cannot explain photoelectric effect, Compton effect, specific heat values.

### Quantum Free Electron Theory
- Developed by Sommerfeld (1928).
- Introduces quantum mechanics and Fermi-Dirac statistics.
- Only electrons near Fermi level contribute to conduction.

### Density of States (DoS)
- Number of available electron states per unit energy per unit volume.
- Important for calculating carrier concentration in solids.

### Kronig-Penney Model
- Models electron motion in periodic potentials.
- Explains formation of energy bands and gaps.

## UNIT 2: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Semiconductors

### Intrinsic Semiconductors
- Pure semiconductors like Si, Ge.
- Conduction occurs by thermally generated electron-hole pairs.
- Fermi level lies at the center of the bandgap.

### Extrinsic Semiconductors
- Created by doping intrinsic semiconductors.
- N-type: Donor impurities (P, As).
- P-type: Acceptor impurities (B, Al).

### Carrier Generation and Recombination
- Optical, phonon (Shockley-Read-Hall), Auger, impact ionization processes.
- Generation creates carriers; recombination annihilates them.
- Lifetime: Time carriers exist before recombination.

## UNIT 3: Optical Transitions and Emissions

### Optical Transitions
- Band-to-band, impurity-to-band, intraband transitions.
- Condition: Photon energy ≥ Eg for band-to-band absorption.

### Emission Types
- **Spontaneous emission:** Random photon emission from excited state.
- **Stimulated emission:** Induced emission by incoming photon.
- **Einstein Coefficients:** Quantify absorption/emission rates.

### Recombination Processes
- **Radiative:** Photon emitted (e.g., LED).
- **Non-radiative:** Energy lost to phonons.
- **Quantum efficiency:** Ratio of radiative recombination to total recombination.

## UNIT 4: Electrical Measurements and Hall Effect

### Resistivity and Ohm’s Law
- V = IR, R = ρL/A.

### Two-Point vs Four-Point Probe
- **Two-point:** Simple, suffers from contact resistance.
- **Four-point:** Separates current and voltage, higher accuracy.
- **Van der Pauw method:** Measures resistivity and Hall effect in flat samples.

### Hall Effect
- Voltage generated perpendicular to current and magnetic field.
- Measures carrier type, concentration, and mobility.

## UNIT 5: Low-Dimensional Systems and Nanotechnology

### Density of States in Low Dimensions
- **3D (bulk):** Continuous states.
- **2D (quantum well):** Constant DoS.
- **1D (quantum wire):** DoS ∝ 1/√E.
- **0D (quantum dot):** Discrete energy levels.

### Nanoscience and Nanotechnology
- Properties depend on size and shape.
- Increased surface-to-volume ratio.
- Optical properties (e.g., gold appears red at nano-size).
- Applications: Solar cells, LEDs, sensors, medical tools.

### Synthesis Techniques
- **Top-down:** Breaking down bulk materials (e.g., lithography).
- **Bottom-up:** Assembling atoms/molecules (e.g., chemical synthesis).
