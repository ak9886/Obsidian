# Tree Terminology
## Root
- Starting Node of a tree is the root node
- Only one
## Edge
- Connecting 2 nodes
- `n` Nodes = `n-1` Nodes
## Parent
- Nodes that have the child nodes
## Degree
- Degree of Node = no. of children per node
- Degree of Tree = highest degree of a node among the nodes of the tree
## Internal Node
- Node
## Leaf Node
- Nodes with no children
## Level
- Each step of tree is the level number
- Starts at 0
## Height
- Number of edges in the longest path from the node to any leaf
- Height of any leaf node is 0
- Height of Tree = Height of Root Node
## Depth
- Number of edges from root node to the particular node is Depth
- Depth of root node is 0
- Depth of tree = Depth of longest path from root to leaf
## Subtree
- Any Child Node creates a sub-tree recursively
## Length of Path
- Number of edges in the path
# Application of Trees
- Trees are use to store simple as well as complex data. Here simple means an integer value, character value and complex data means a structure or record.
- Trees are often used for implementing other types of data structures like hash tables, sets and maps.
- A self-balancing tree, Red-Black Tree is used to store kernel scheduling, to pre-empt massively multi-processor computer operating system use.
- Trees are used for complex compiler instructions
## Binary Trees
- A Binary Tree is a data structure specified as a set of so-called node elements. The topmost element in a binary is called the root ode, and each node has 0,1, or at most 2 child notes
## Complete Binary Tree
- Except the last level, all the nodes need to be completely filled
- Nodes fill from left to right
## Representation of Binary Tree
- Each Node - Three portion - Data portion, left child pointer, right child pointer
## Linked List Representation of a Tree
```Psuedo
Struct NODE{
	Struct NODE *leftchild;
	int value;
	Struct NODE *rightchild
};
```
## Expression Tree
- Used to store algebraic expression
- Example: exp=x+y/z*w-u
- Can be written as 
## Binary Tree Traversal
- Traversal - visiting all node only once
- Based on the order of visiting
	- In order
	- Pre order
	- Post Order
### In Order
- Traverse left node, visit root node, traverse right node
- #### Algorithm:
	- Repeat Step 2-4 if Tree!=NULL
	- Inorder(Tree-> left)
	- Write(Tree-> Data)
	- Inorder(Tree-> Right)
	- End
