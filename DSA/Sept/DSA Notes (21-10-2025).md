#DSA 
# Hash Functions
- The total possible number of hash functions for _n_ items assigned to _m_ positions in a table (_n_ < _m_) is mn.
- The number of perfect hash functions is equal to the number (m-n)!
- With 50 elements and a 100-position array, we would have a total of 10500 hash functions
## Folding
- In folding, the keys are divided into parts which are then combined (or "folded") together and often transformed into the address.
- Two types of folding are used, **_shift folding_** and **_boundary folding_**
