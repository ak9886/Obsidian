## Example 1
- Initially, the stack is empty
- Push 5 to the stack, now stack has one value
	- push(5)
- Push 3 to the stack, not stack has 2 values (5 and 3)
	- push(3)
- Pop out both the values and add them together...
	- value1 = pop()
	- value2 = pop()
	- result = value1+value2
	- push(result)
	- Push another 8 to the stack, now there are 2 values (8 and 8)
		- push(8)
	- Push a 2 to the stack, there are now 3 values (8,8 and 2)
		- push(2)
	- Finally, the stack is:

| 2   |
| --- |
| 8   |
| 8   |
STACK
```Python
n=int(input("Enter Number: "))
a=1
while (n!=0):
    a*=n
    n-=1
print(a)

```
