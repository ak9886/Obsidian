### What is a polynomial
- A polynomial p(x) is the expression in variable x which is in the form (ax<sup>n</sup> +bx<sup>n-1</sup> +....+ jx+k)
- We can use polynomials for linked lists

- For 5x<sup>2</sup>+11x+2

# Cursor Based Implementation
## Methodology
- Pointers **Store** the memory address of another variable
## What is a Cursor List?
- A CursorList is an array version of a linked list
- It is an array of list nodes but instead of each node containing a pointer to the next item in the linked list.

# Doubly Linked Lists
- Doubly Lined lists
	- Each node points to not only successor but the predecessor
	- There are two <font color="#c0504d">NULL</font>: At the first and last nodes in the list
	- Advantage: given a node, it is east to visit its predecessor. convenient to traverse lists backwards.
# Operations
- Create a node
- Insertion at beginning of a list
- Insertion at end of the list
- Insertion at any given position
- Delete a node from beginning
- Delete a node from the end
- Delete a node from any given position
- temp --> next = head
- head --> prev = temp
- temp --> prev = NULL
-               head= temp
