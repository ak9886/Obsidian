#DSA
Two types of commands: Primitive and Non-primitive
Non-primitive: User-defined and derived
You can access the member of the structure if you can access the variable of the structure

**Self referential Structure**
```c++

struct Node
{
	int value;
	int a;
} s1,s2;
```

```c++
s1.value = 5;
s1.a = 4;
s1.next = &s2;
s1.next.value = s2;
```
 
 â†‘ **IMPORTANT**

```c++
Struct Node
{
	int a = 5;
} S2;
```

```c++
Struct Node
{
	Struct Node *next;
	
} s1,s2;
s1.next.next.a;
```
