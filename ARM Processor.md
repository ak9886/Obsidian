# ARM Core Dataflow Model
## Introduction
- An ARM Core has functional units connected by data buses.
- Data enters the processor core through the _data_ bus. the data may be an instruction to execute or a data item.

## ARM Registers
- General purpose registers hold either data or an address.
- Protected mode usually used when executing applications
- The ARM Processor has 3 registers assigned to a particular task or special function: *r13, r14* and *r15*. They are frequently given different labels to differentiate them from the other registers
- Shaded Registers usually identify the assigned applets
