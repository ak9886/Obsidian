## 1. What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a formal language for giving instructions to a computer.

**Types:**
- **Low-Level Languages** – close to machine code (Assembly, Machine Language)
- **High-Level Languages** – closer to human language (Python, Java, C++)
- **Scripting Languages** – often interpreted (Python, Perl, JavaScript)
- **Object-Oriented Languages** – based on objects (Java, C++, Python)
- **Functional Languages** – computation as math functions (Haskell, Lisp)
- **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)** – for specific areas (SQL, HTML, MATLAB)

---

## 2. Elements of Programming Languages
- **Variables** – store and manipulate data
- **Data Types** – integers, floats, chars, strings, booleans, arrays
- **Operators** – arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment
- **Control Structures** – conditionals, loops, branching
- **Functions/Procedures** – reusable blocks of code
- **Expressions** – evaluate to a value
- **Statements** – perform an action
- **Syntax** – rules for writing code
- **Comments** – ignored by compiler, for documentation
- **Libraries/Modules** – prewritten code for reuse

---

## 3. Programming Language Theory
Focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of programming languages.

**Topics:**
- Syntax & Semantics
- Type Systems
- Language Design & Implementation
- Language Semantics
- Program Analysis
- Formal Methods
- Language Paradigms
- Compiler & Interpreter Design
- Language Expressiveness

## 4. Böhm–Jacopini Theorem
Any program can be written using:
1. **Sequence**
2. **Selection (if-else)**
3. **Iteration (loops)**

Promotes **structured programming** and avoids unnecessary `goto` statements.

---

## 5. Multiple Programming Paradigms
- **Procedural** – step-by-step, functions (C, Pascal)
- **Object-Oriented (OOP)** – objects with data & behavior (Java, Python)
- **Functional** – pure functions, immutability (Haskell, Lisp)
- **Declarative** – describe what, not how (SQL, HTML)
- **Logic** – rules & relationships (Prolog)
- **Concurrent** – multiple tasks running together (Go, Erlang)

---

## 6. Programming Paradigm Hierarchy
1. Imperative
2. Structured
3. Object-Oriented
4. Functional
5. Logic
6. Concurrent

---

## 7. Imperative Paradigm
- **Procedural** – code in functions/subroutines
- **Object-Oriented** – objects encapsulate data & methods
- **Parallel Processing** – multiple tasks run simultaneously

---

## 8. Declarative Paradigm
- **Logic Programming** – rules & inference (Prolog)
- **Functional Programming** – pure functions (Haskell, Lisp)
- **Database Processing** – SQL queries

---

## 9. Machine Code & Paradigms
- **Machine Code** – binary instructions for CPU
- **Procedural with Machine Code** – sequential instructions
- **OOP with Machine Code** – manually manage objects at low level

---

## 10. Suitability of Multiple Paradigms
**Advantages:**
- Flexibility & Expressiveness
- Code Reusability
- Problem-Specific Solutions
- Easier Learning & Transition
- Language Evolution & Innovation
