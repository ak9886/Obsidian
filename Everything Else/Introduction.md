Hello, my name is Adarsh Koshy. I'm currently studying in SRM Kattankulathur. I did my 11th and 12th in Chettinad Vidyashram. Before that, I studied from 7th to 10th in Akshar Arbol International School. I also studied in Kirkwood Intermediate School in Christchurch, New Zealand for my 7th and half of 8th. I play the drums and the piano. I am in the grade 6 for Drums and 5 for Piano. I enjoy playing video games, particularly Shooter and exploration games like Fortnite, Minecraft, Legend Of Zelda, etc. 

I am naturally an easy-going person, and like to take life as it comes, without much fuss. I like to stay inside all day rather than going out. My mother hates me for it...

I like studying, when it's not academic.. Academic wise, I suck at studying, and like to experiment on my own rather than traditional teaching methods. 

I really like Minute Maid's Orange Juice and would drink it, rain or shine.
