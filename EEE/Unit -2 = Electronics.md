## ðŸ”˜ PN Junction Diode Structure and Depletion Region

### Structure

A PN junction diode is formed by joining P-type and N-type semiconductor materials. At the junction of these materials, a **depletion region** forms, which is devoid of free charge carriers.

- **P-type region:** Contains holes (positive charge carriers)
- **N-type region:** Contains electrons (negative charge carriers)
- **Depletion region:** Neutral zone due to recombination of electrons and holes near the junction

### Key Points

- The junction creates an electric field that opposes further movement of carriers.
- No current flows until an external voltage is applied.

## Diode Vâ€“I Characteristics (Forward and Reverse Bias)

### Forward Bias

- Positive terminal of the battery is connected to the P-side, and the negative to the N-side.
- Reduces the width of the depletion region.
- Current flows after the threshold voltage (~0.7V for silicon).

### Reverse Bias

- Positive terminal connected to the N-side, negative to the P-side.
- Increases the depletion width, blocks current flow.
- Only a small leakage current flows until breakdown voltage.

## BJT Circuit Diagram (NPN/PNP Biasing)

### NPN Transistor

- Current flows from **collector to emitter** when base is positive relative to emitter.
- Majority charge carriers are electrons.

### PNP Transistor

- Current flows from **emitter to collector** when base is negative relative to emitter.
- Majority charge carriers are holes.

### Biasing

- Proper voltage at base-emitter junction is needed to turn on the transistor.
- E<sub>B</sub>, C<sub>C</sub>, and B<sub>B</sub> are emitter, collector, and base terminals respectively.

## Basic Logic Gates

- **AND Gate:** Output is high only if all inputs are high.
- **OR Gate:** Output is high if any input is high.
- **NOT Gate:** Inverts input signal.
- **NAND Gate:** NOT of AND.
- **NOR Gate:** NOT of OR.
- **XOR Gate:** Output is high when inputs are different.
- **XNOR Gate:** Output is high when inputs are the same.

### Truth Table Notation

- 1 = HIGH, 0 = LOW
